# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                Poly = Many
#                Morphe = Form


# TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
# 1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
# 2. "Duck typing" = Object must have unnecessary attributes/methods

#1.Inheritance
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape:
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self,radius):
        self.radius=radius
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius **2
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,side):
        self.side=side
    def area(self):
        return self.side**2
class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self,base,height):
        self.base=base
        self.height=height
    def area(self):
        return self.base *self.height *0.5
    
class Pizza(Circle):# pizza here has polymorphism which is also a shape and also a circle
    def __init__(self,topping,radius):
        super().__init__(radius)
        self.topping =topping

shapes = [Circle(4), Square(6), Triangle(6,7), Pizza("pepperoni",15)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.area())


#2.Duck Typing = Another way to achieve polymorphism besides Inheritance 
#                Object must have the minimum necessary attributes/methods
#                "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck"

class Animal:
    alive = True

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("WOOF!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("MEOW!")

class Car:# meets requirement to acheive polymorphism 
    alive = False
    def speak(self):  ## The Car uses this to match the attributes for duck quacking for POLYMORHPISM
        print('Honk!')

animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Car()]

    animal.speak()
    print(animal.alive)
